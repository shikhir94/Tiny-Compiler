4. go to your directory.
5. go to tws/tiny.

7. that it!

some sample programs are there in tests folder as well as some complex test cases in test-progs folder

to run these test cases you need:
1. come to tiny directory.
2. type command ./tc tests/filename or test-progs/filename.

NOTE: before running any test case please open the test case first(in any editor you want) and read the comments describing what the test case do, will help you a lot.
